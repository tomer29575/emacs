;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Implements a "lite" variant of Emacs markers, similar to Alpha's
;; mark stack. Works with pairs point/buffer, that will be henceforth
;; called lite markers. Two commands are provided:
;; `interactive-lite-mark-push' (bound, Alpha-like, to C-,) pushes on
;; a proprietary stack the current position and buffer as a lite
;; marker; `interactive-lite-mark-pop' (bound, Alpha-like, to C-.)
;; sets point to the position stored at the top of the proprietary
;; mark stack (switching the buffer if necessary), and pops the stack.
;; 
;; To use these commands, place this file where Emacs can see it, and
;; evaluate (or place in your init file -- normally .emacs or init.el)
;; one of the following lines:
;;
;;    (load "lite-markers")
;;    (require 'lite-markers)
;;
